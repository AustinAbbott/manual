title: Journeys Off Road LED Bumper

## Things you'll need

- Journeys Off Road LED Bumper kit (includes unpainted bumper, mounting brackets, LED light bar, LED spot lights; bolts, nuts, and washers for bracket with handle)
- Primer
- Paint
- Wiring harness with switch


## Questions I had while installing

Do I need multiple wiring harnesses for independent control of the light bar and spot lights?


My question to Bing Chat:
"I have a bumper that has a light bar and two led spot lights. I'd like to control the light bar independently of the spot lights. How would I do that with relays?"

Answer: 
"You can use two relays to control the light bar and spot lights independently."
