## Problem: Slider door lock engages repeatedly while driving over 20 MPH, door lock buttons do not work

Reading a coulple forums online, replacing the door lock relay should fix the issue. I'm going to try with this part number: D1780C

From a comment on fixya ([Internet Archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20190911130352/http://www.fixya.com/cars/t2188062-need_location_power_door_lock_relay_2002)), "If your door locks are not working and your cigarette lighter is also not working the fuse is burned out. On my 2001 astro van it is #13 in the fuse box under the steering wheel. I have replaced mine and so far no problems. Good Luck."

## What fixed my problem
TBD
