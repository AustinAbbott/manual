## Things you'll need

- Journeys Off Road LED Bumper kit (includes unpainted bumper, mounting brackets, LED light bar, LED spot lights; bolts, nuts, and washers for bracket with handle)

## Questions I had while installing

Do I need multiple wiring harnesses for independent control of the light bar and spot lights?
