title: ABS + Brake Light Issue
---

## Issue: My ABS and emergency brake lights are on 

#### Chevrolet ABS Codes shown for my van: 

- C0221 - Right Front Wheel Speed Sensor Circuit Open
- C0281 - Stop Lap Switch Circuit
- C0265 - Solenoid Control Monitor Error
- C0241 - EBCM Control Valve Circuit
- C0222 - Right Front Wheel Speed Signal Missing

## Step 1: See if the sensor just needs cleaned
Based on the plethora of error codes related to ABS my van displays, I doubt this is the case for mine, but I'll try it all the same.
