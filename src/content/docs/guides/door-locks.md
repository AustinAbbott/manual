## Problem: Slider door lock engages repeatedly while driving over 20 MPH, door lock buttons do not work

## Fixes I've tried:

#### Fixya suggestion ❌

> If your door locks are not working and your cigarette lighter is also not working the fuse is burned out. On my 2001 astro van it is #13 in the fuse box under the steering wheel. I have replaced mine and so far no problems. Good Luck.
