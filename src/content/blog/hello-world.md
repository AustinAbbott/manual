title: So, you decided to buy an Astro Van

Living in the West near the Rocky Mountains, $100k+ Sprinter vans are everywhere. And yeah, you want one (how could you not?) But for the price of a condo? After a while, you start wondering if there's another way. What if you could get all the adventure, off-roading, and mountain bike carrying capabilities for a tenth of the price?

Enter the Astro Van.

Sure, it's older, maybe a little rough around the edges, but the AWD model with a few mods are kick-butt. Built like a truck, better fuel economy than a modern 4Runner, with enough room to carry yourself and 7 friends. What's not to like? If you can find one in good shape, nab it.

That's what happened to me just over a month ago. I wasn't in the market for a new car, but every so often the universe takes all deciding out of the equation, and you find yourself owning a new van over the course of a long weekend.

I'm hoping to use this blog to document my journey of owning and maintaining the rig, with some useful info for future Astro Van owners. Cheers!
