### What size wipers do I need?
All Astro Van years use 18-inch wipers for the front, and 13-inch wipers for the rear.

### What connector type do they use?
Based on my 2002 model, Pin Arm.

### Can you use the same wiper for driver side and passenger side?
Yes.

### What I bought
Because I was in a hurry, I went with [cheap OEM ACDelco 8-4418 wipers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004969RC). I'll probably get something better next time, though.
